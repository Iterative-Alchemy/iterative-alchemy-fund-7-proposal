MODULAR GAME DEVELOPMENT TOOLS


PROBLEM:
Game developers need NFT-based systems and tools that are audited, certified, and battle-tested.


SOLUTION:
IA Labs will engage MLabs, dcSpark, Five Binaries, and others in the Cardano ecosystem to develop modular tooling solutions for game devs.


RELEVANT EXPERIENCE:
William Mason - Iterative Alchemy Labs

Active in the Cardano space since April 2021. 

Previously worked with PIVX, Cardstack, and Nexus.


CALL TO ACTION:

Recently, Uncle Charles issued a call to action* to build certifiable applications for the upcoming Cardano dApp Store. It is well understood that the reputation of the Cardano ecosystem greatly benefits from developers taking the time to build solid, robust applications that are resistant to the growing onslaught of bad actors, the exponential growth of the ecosystem, and usage outside of the scope of the original application.

Iterative Alchemy Labs, with coding and backend support from MLabs, will build a robust fractional minting application based on the open-source Fracada protocol built by the team over at dcSpark. The scope of this proposal encompasses the production and delivery of that tool. 

Once the first version of the fractional NFT minting tool is complete, it will enter a continuous development cadence whereby the code is regularly refactored to add greater efficiency, portability, security, and functionality.

Moving forward, the (first) real-world application will be a serialized founder's access token which will grant premium access and functionality to the upcoming Rasayana NFT project as well as collaborative functionality with other well-known projects in the space.

Sales of the Founder access token will join various other funding vehicles such as founder investment, secondary sales of NFTs, community contributions, and stake pool operation revenues to further the development of the fractionalized minting tool as well as identity and governance solutions, dynamically composable NFT protocols, and other tools and functionality destined to take their place as certified content on the upcoming Cardano dApp Store.

IA Labs intends to work closely with MLabs far into the future on the no-code toolkit, Double DAO, and Megaplex marketplace solutions as the Cardano ecosystem evolves to meet the needs of the community. IA Labs also intends to work with BuffyBot Publishing, Lovelace Worlds, Five Binaries, and other developer teams within the space to achieve similarly compatible goals.

IMPACT:

Draw gamers from the online card game genre to the Cardano NFT community.
Increase the number of gaming-based applications by creating easy-to-use tools for developers.
Help create, adapt, and standardize the tools game developers use to build play-to-earn, build-to-earn, and learn-to-earn mechanics into their games.
Increase the availability of game-specific cNFTs with tools for creating cross-platform assets compatible with PlayerMint, Cornucopias, Pavias, Cardania, and others.
Create secure and robust access and utility token compatible with any project using Cardano native tokens.
Increase the number of gaming-based content creators that are drawn to Cardano.
Operate as a first-class citizen within the PlayerMint, Pavias, and Cornucopias ecosystems to help establish and grow the foundation of trust and adoption in the gaming community.
Play a significant role in the foundation and evolution of the Cardano gaming community.
DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:

3 months:

Successful launch of the fractionalized NFT minting tool.
Successful launch of Founder's utility token.
Successful funding from Catalyst Fund 7.
Successful launch of the website and social media channels.

Iterative Alchemy Labs

https://iterativealchemy.io (under development)

https://github.com/Iterative-Alchemy/iterative-alchemy-fund-7-proposal

Iterative Alchemy Labs is being built from the ground up as a Continuous Delivery software development shop whose first projects will be a no-code GameFi toolkit and Rasayana, an NFT-based computer card game.

 

MLabs

https://mlabs.city

https://github.com/mlabs-haskell

MLabs is an IOG partner with more than 65 Haskell developers working on notable projects within the Cardano ecosystem such as SundaeSwap and Liqwid, as well as Ardana, Cardstarter, and the PlayerMint GameFi platform among others.

 

Fracada Protocol

https://github.com/dcSpark/fracada

Fracada Protocol is an open-source Haskell-based fractionalized NFT minting protocol developed by the team at dcSpark. Under this protocol, an original NFT is locked up behind a certain number of NFTs that are minted representing fractional pieces of the original NFT. All of the fractional NFTs must be burned using the original keys to release the original NFT, but the original NFT can hold common metadata or code to provide a functionality seed to all of the fractional NFTs thus minted.

 

Rasayana

https://rasayana.io (under development)

https://github.com/Iterative-Alchemy/rasayana_io

Rasayana is an NFT-based computer card game aiming for a level of detail and functionality roughly on par with Magic the Gathering: Arena. Future versions will also include land-based gameplay allowing ownership, residence, commerce, mining, building, and combat among other things.
